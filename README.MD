About This Project
This repository contains the work from a Software Architecture class project, where we built a website using ASP.NET MVC as part of a school assignment. The project involved creating both the backend (using C# and SQL) and the frontend (using HTML and CSS) for a web application.

What We Did:

-Developed a Web Application: Implemented a fully functional website with features designed to meet the project requirements.
-Used ASP.NET MVC: Leveraged the ASP.NET MVC framework for building the backend and managing the application's data and logic.
-Designed the Frontend: Created the user interface using HTML and CSS, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience.

What I Learned:

-Full-Stack Development: Gained hands-on experience in building both the backend and frontend of a web application.
-Project Management: Managed project tasks and collaborated with team members through sprints, learning effective ways to communicate and organize work.
-ASP.NET MVC Framework: Deepened understanding of the ASP.NET MVC framework, including how to structure applications and handle data.

This project was a valuable learning experience, providing insights into both the technical and collaborative aspects of software development.
