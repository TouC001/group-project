# Software Architecture Team Charlie
Welcome to Software Architecture!

This class is a continuation of CAD. You will be expected to work together as a team to create a website using ASP.NET MVC of your own invention. This allows you to write a backend web application using C# / SQL, and with a frontend in HTML / CSS. Feel free to delete or edit this file to your liking. To edit this, open the *README.MD* file in the root of your repo. DevOps will accept standard MarkDown syntax for this file.

In CAD, you did everything in one-week sprints. In this class, you will be asked to run in three-week sprints. The first one starting on August 28th, 2023 and ending on September 17th, 2023. At the end of the first sprint, please make some rough ERDs and wireframes, you will then be asked to pitch your idea to the class in the form of a presentation. At the end of sprints 2, 3, and 4, you would give presentations to tell the class how your project is coming along. At the end of sprint 5, you will do a final presentation, you'll be asked to reintroduce your project, and go over the entire process you've gone through this semester.

To start, please introduce yourselves in your Slack channel, and setup your environment for this class per the directions below. Within the next couple of days, please get a hold of your team, and try to get a meeting setup. This meeting should include Dominic and Dillon. In that meeting, your team will choose a website to create using ASP.NET MVC.

You will want to follow the instructions at [Environment Setup](https://check.ntc.edu/13b5a89db731) to setup your environment before working on Lesson 1 Mary's Toy Store / Group Project.

This class takes the form of two assignments each week. One assignment will ask you to build Mary's Toy Store, an e-commerce website that takes orders to sell toys. That is meant to be done on your own, please commit that to your own personal repository. The second assignment each week will look at your group project. This group assignment will look at your responsiveness in Slack, the quality of commits to this repo, and the work performed in the DevOps board.

For your convenience, a copy of the Mary's Toy Store starting code, a sample gitignore, and a blank scheduling sheet are provided. The Mary's Toy Store start code is provided here to act as a starting point to what will eventually become your group project. You are free to organize the repository as you see fit.

## Git Configuration
In some semesters, we have had issues where a student would forget to change their username / email in Git, so it becomes difficult to give credit to the proper student for their work, instead giving us an alias or Github/Bitbucket username. If you haven't already, please open a git bash in the root of your repo, and run the following commands, providing your current name and student email address.
> git config user.name "Your Name"
>
> git config user.email "youremail@students.ntc.edu"
